The NoBIAS facility, together with the Jug lab, will organize the "Deep-learning

Lots of great speakers and many algorithms to try out on your own data! :rocket:

Stay tuned for the official announcement and the application deadline!

## DL4MIA@EMBO

In spring 2024, we will be organizing the first EMBO sponsored DL4MIA.

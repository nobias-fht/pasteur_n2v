# Noise2Void

For this practical, you will need a Gmail address and a Google drive access,
if you don't have any, pair up with someone for the first part of the practical.

## Downloading data

We are going to work with the [following dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/3713315#.XnEC6i2cZQI).
Download it and place it in a folder in your Google Drive.

## Starting the notebook

We will use the [N2V 2D notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HenriquesLab/ZeroCostDL4Mic/blob/master/Colab_notebooks/Noise2Void_2D_ZeroCostDL4Mic.ipynb). The rest of the notebooks can be found
on the [ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/ZeroCostDL4Mic/wiki).

## Questions

In the next pages, you will find some questions corresponding to various sections
of the notebook.

Try to understand them and think a little bit about what the answer could be while
going through the notebook. Don't hesitate to discuss it with the people around
you and with the TAs.

!!!Warning
    Don't spend too much time on trying to answer by yourself all questions.
    The answers are available on the next page each time, and are meant to just
    bring you some important insights into the algorithm.

On your mark, ready, go! :rocket:

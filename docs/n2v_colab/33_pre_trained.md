# 3.3 Pre-trained model

??? question "Using pre-trained weights"
    Should you avoid using a pre-trained network that was trained on vastly
    different data that the one you want to train on?

??? question "Learning rate"
    The notebook states that "it is advisable to also load the learning rate
    that was used when the training ended". Why is that?

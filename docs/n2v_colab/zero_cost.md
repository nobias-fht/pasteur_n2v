# ZeroCostDL4Mic

ZeroCostDL4Mic is a collection of Jupyter notebooks for Google Colab. They are
meant to quickly get you started on learning how to use deep-learning methods
specifically created for microscopy image analysis.

Google Colab itself provides the computations resources needed and does so at
zero cost. ZeroCostDL4Mic is designed for researchers that have little or no
coding expertise to quickly test, train and use popular neural networks
approaches.

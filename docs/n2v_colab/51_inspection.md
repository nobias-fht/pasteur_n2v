# 5.1 Inspection of the loss function

??? question "N2V "ground-truth""
    N2V is a very peculiar deep-learning algorithm. It is a so-called
    self-supervised method. What is used as "ground-truth" in N2V?

??? question "N2V loss"
    Given your answer to the previous question, how can we interpret the N2V
    loss function value?

??? question "Low number of validation"
    What could happen to the validation loss curve if you have too little
    validation examples?

# Data and notebooks

The first thing is to get the data and the notebooks. Here, we've already downloaded some data for you, which you can find in `/pasteur/appa/scratch/neubias/n2v/exercise/data`.

Simply copy the `exercise` folder to your folder, using the following command:

```console title="Copying the exercises"
cp -r /pasteur/appa/scratch/neubias/n2v/exercise n2v_exercise
```

!!!Note
    Instead of the SEM data, you could use your own data. Copy your data in the `notebooks/data` folder instead of the tiff files. You will need to adapt the notebook to make sure that the data is correctly loaded and the shape fitting.

    Note that the notebook expects tiff images to be in the `data` folder.

# Bonus episode

In the lecture, we mentioned `N2V2`. It can be used in 2D (not 3D yet...) by
slightly changing the configuration, using the following parameters:

- blurpool=True
- skip_skipone=True
- n2v_manipulator="median"
- unet_residual=False

Try it out and compare with the previous result! Don't forget to save somewhere
the data previously generated by the prediction notebook.

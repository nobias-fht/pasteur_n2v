# Getting started

Neural networks can do useful things. Their deployment within user-friendly
tools is, unfortunately, lacking behind. Hence, methods we would like to apply
to our data are not available in Fiji or ilastik quite yet. The latest methods
can only be used by the ones “brave” enough to expose themselves to some
amount of computer source code...

Today we will all be brave! Now, please take a seat, open a browser, and buckle
up.

# Getting started

During this course, we will run deep learning algorithms on the HPC. To this
purpose, we will use `jupyte notebook`.

Importantly, in order to visualize the notebooks on your machine, we will need
to do **port forwarding**. This requires sending the visual information over
`ssh` to your machine, so as to display it your local browser.

In the next sections, we run through an example on how to do this.

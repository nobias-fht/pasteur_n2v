# Noise2Void practical

In this 2h practical, we will get familiar with [Noise2Void](https://github.com/juglab/n2v),
a self-supervised denoising algorithm that was introduced in the lecture.

We will start by using online resources (ZeroCostDL4Mic) before running the
algorithm on the HPC. Don't hesitate to try running N2V on your own data during
the second part of the practical.

!!!Note
    This practical is inspired from the courses we give each year, in
    particular [DL4MIA](https://github.com/dl4mia) and
    [Quantitative Imaging](https://meetings.cshl.edu/courses.aspx?course=C-QICM&year=23).

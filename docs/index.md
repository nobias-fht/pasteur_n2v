# Image restoration

In this short 2h practical, we will use online resources to run deep-learning
algorithms.

This practical is inspired from the courses that we give or participate in
each year, in  particular [DL4MIA](https://github.com/dl4mia) and
[Quantitative Imaging](https://meetings.cshl.edu/courses.aspx?course=C-QICM&year=23).
